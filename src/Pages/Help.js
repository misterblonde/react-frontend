          <li>
            <b>CONNECT:</b>Make sure your metamask wallet is connected to this
            page. In the top right corner it should display a shortened version
            of your wallet address. If it says "connect wallet" instead you are
            not connected. Try clicking on the "connect wallet" and wait for the
            metamask window to pop up, so you can enter your password. If this
            doesn't work, click on the water droplet to go to the main
            Infrastructure DAO page and click on the big connect wallet button
            there. If Metamask is laggy, reload the page, if this doesn't help
            start your browser. Please use either google chrome or firefox.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>MINT:</b>Now you're connected, great! Go to the main page and
            mint an NFT. Accept the minting transaction with your metamask
            wallet. Then just wait until a little notification pops up in the
            bottom left of your screening confirming the successful mint. It
            will take a little moment. Once the notification has popped up, you
            can check to see which token ID you bought on the profile page. The
            profile page can be found if you click on the little user icon in
            the top right corner of the screen, a drop-down menu with a Profile
            option will appear.

            please.
